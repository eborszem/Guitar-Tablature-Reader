# Guitar Tablature Reader
Guitar tablature is how guitar music is read, like sheet music for a piano. There are six horizontal lines representing the six guitar strings (EADGBE). Every number on these lines represents the frets your fingers would go on to play a chord.
So:
E 0 (E)
B 0 (B)
G 1 (G#)
D 2 (E)
A 2 (B)
E 0 (E)
is an E major chord.
When the user clicks on a chord shape like the one above, they will be shown a fretboard (with the notes prefilled for convenience). You can modify the chord's notes or duration. You can also turn it into a rest (currently represented with negative numbers) by clicking those prefilled notes.
This project allows for users to create and play guitar tablature. Users can seamlessly switch between songs, which are stored and persist.
